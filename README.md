<!-- # CRUD System for Product Management and Sales

## Description

This project is a robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for managing products and their sales. It features user role differentiation, input validation, and effective session management. Built for streamlined product operations, this system ensures data integrity and an interactive user experience.

---

## Features

### **Validation Logic**
- Comprehensive validation for fields like product name, code, and price.
- Checks for unique product codes to prevent duplication.
- Real-time error handling with visual indicators (e.g., input borders) for better user feedback.

### **CRUD Operations**
- **Create**: Add new products with details stored in `localStorage`.
- **Read**: Dynamically display products in a table using the `productToTable` function.
- **Update**: Modify product details with changes reflected in both the UI and storage.
- **Delete**: Remove products permanently from `localStorage` and the table.

### **Session Management**
- Persistent data stored in `localStorage`.
- Temporary session states managed using `sessionStorage`.

### **User Roles**
- **Admin Users**: Access to all CRUD functionalities with enhanced permissions.
- **Regular Users**: Limited access for simplified interaction.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technologies Used:**
- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: To implement the functionality and interactivity.
- **localStorage and sessionStorage**: To persist and retrieve user data.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Code Duplication**
   - Reduce redundancy in validation and error handling by creating reusable utility functions.

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Replace linear searches in large arrays with hash maps or objects for quicker lookups.

3. **User Experience**
   - Add success notifications for operations like adding or updating products.
   - Replace `confirm()` with modals for a smoother interface.

4. **Incomplete Logic**
   - Fix unfinished logic in the `addBill` function, particularly around error messages for invalid purchases.

5. **Code Organization**
   - Break the codebase into modular files (e.g., `validation.js`, `crud.js`, `ui.js`) to enhance readability and maintainability.

6. **Edge Cases**
   - Handle scenarios like deleting all products or exceeding stock limits gracefully.
